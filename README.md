# Factor_Comparison
There is a script for Auto and another for Home. The majority of the codes are the same. I decided to have 2 separate scripts for ease of maintenance and enhancement. The requirements for these 2 lines can be a lot different in many aspects. In addition, this makes the script more readable and understandble for team members who don't have much experience with Python programming language.

What does the program do?
